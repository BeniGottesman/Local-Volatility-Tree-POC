It is a code which let us to price American or Game Option under a general local volatility diffusion. 
It is a trinomial tree, with the particularity to be recombinant. 
In this method we ease off on the continuity assumption, and we work with diffusions with measurable discontinuous bounded coefficients. 
We build a sequence of random times with increment of the diffusion between two times belongs to some set 
                                  {-sigma x sqrt(T/n),0,+sigma x sqrt(T/n)}, 
and the expectation of the difference between two times equals to T/n.


Here the notation n is the discretization parameter and T is the maturity date.
